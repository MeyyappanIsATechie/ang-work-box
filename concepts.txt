1. State Management (Beyond Basics)
Tailoring Needed: Managing state isn't always about Redux, MobX, or RxJS. For complex applications, you might need to design custom state solutions that balance between local and global state or optimize performance.
Examples:
Implementing an event-based pub-sub system for React/Angular.
Custom solutions for state normalization in large apps to reduce redundancy.
2. Advanced Form Handling
Tailoring Needed: Industry applications often have complex forms (e.g., conditional fields, validation, or dynamic forms).
Examples:
Build custom validation logic beyond libraries like Formik or Reactive Forms.
Implement progressive form-loading logic for large datasets.
3. Custom Component Libraries
Tailoring Needed: Off-the-shelf UI libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap are helpful but may not meet branding or performance needs.
Examples:
Design reusable, accessible UI components tailored for your app (e.g., modals, dropdowns, tables).
Optimize tree-shaking for component imports to reduce app bundle size.
4. Routing and Lazy Loading
Tailoring Needed: Complex routing setups often require custom solutions, especially for:
Dynamic routes (e.g., user-specific or role-based).
Nested and guarded routes.
Lazy loading strategies for critical-path rendering.
5. Real-Time Features
Tailoring Needed: Real-time data fetching and updates require WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or Polling integrations.
Examples:
Custom WebSocket wrappers for maintaining persistent connections.
Implementing backoff algorithms for reconnection.
6. Performance Optimization
Tailoring Needed: Frameworks and libraries don't fully optimize by default. You need to:
Manage code-splitting and lazy loading (JS, images, CSS).
Implement custom memoization strategies for avoiding unnecessary re-renders in React or Angular.
Use IntersectionObserver for lazy loading images and components.
7. Security
Tailoring Needed: Security is always custom and cannot rely solely on libraries.
Examples:
Implement robust authentication (OAuth, JWT, or custom tokens).
Design secure role-based access control (RBAC).
Create custom CSRF/XSS protection layers.
8. API Integrations
Tailoring Needed: Complex APIs often require custom handling.
Examples:
Implement API retry strategies with exponential backoff.
Write middleware for managing interceptors (e.g., for logging, caching, authentication tokens).
9. Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)
Tailoring Needed: Frameworks provide tools but implementing a PWA that:
Works offline with tailored service workers.
Implements advanced caching strategies (e.g., stale-while-revalidate).
Provides custom app shell architecture.
10. Accessibility (a11y)
Tailoring Needed: Industry-grade apps must meet accessibility standards.
Examples:
Custom keyboard navigation logic for modals or menus.
Testing and tailoring for screen readers (e.g., ARIA roles).
11. Testing
Tailoring Needed: Industry apps require robust test coverage:
Custom unit tests for components and services.
Tailored end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright for app-specific workflows.
12. Multi-Language Support (i18n & l10n)
Tailoring Needed: Implementing internationalization requires:
Custom pluralization rules or date/time formats.
Handling dynamic content translations (e.g., fetched from an API).
13. Custom Build Optimization
Tailoring Needed: Pre-built configurations in frameworks like CRA (Create React App) or Angular CLI often need:
Custom Webpack/Vite configurations for specific needs.
Tailored CI/CD pipelines with optimizations (e.g., Docker, caching strategies).
14. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Tailoring Needed: For React (Next.js) or Angular Universal:
Optimize SSR with custom caching and critical-path rendering.
Handle dynamic routing and state hydration seamlessly.
15. Error Handling and Observability
Tailoring Needed: Build robust error boundaries and logging.
Examples:
Custom error boundaries in React.
Centralized error handling services for Angular.
16. Micro-Frontend Architecture
Tailoring Needed: In complex, distributed systems:
Tailor custom module federation strategies.
Build inter-app communication channels for micro-frontends.
17. Data Visualization
Tailoring Needed: Libraries like D3.js provide tools, but:
Custom charting solutions tailored to datasets.
Build responsive, interactive visualizations.
18. Custom Animations
Tailoring Needed: Libraries like Framer Motion and Angular Animations are great, but sometimes:
Handcrafted SVG animations for unique UIs.
Build animations for complex workflows.
19. Deployment
Tailoring Needed: Automation and scaling require:
Custom CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
Optimized containerization (e.g., Docker).
20. Scaling and Architecture
Tailoring Needed: Industry-grade apps require:
Efficient state and data management for distributed teams.
Building scalable systems that handle traffic spikes.
